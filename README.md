Credit to ChatGPT, Romain's Services, and Eric Pogue's Potpourri example of a Dice Roller website.

To use this website:  Select the number of dice you would like to roll for the attacker.  Then click the button to then roll the dice and it will output the results to the screen.  Perform this same action with the Defender's dice and click the button to get the roll results for the defenders.
